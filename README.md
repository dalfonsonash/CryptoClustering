# CryptoClustering
This challenge involves the use of Python and unsupervised learning to predict the affect on cryptocurrencies by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Starter Code
The Starter Code folder contains the final Python script saved as Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.  The Resources folder contains the CSV file,
crypto_market_data.csv, which was used to complete the challenge.

## plot_graph_photos
While pushing the completed Python code to GitHub, the plots and graphs do not appear.  I added this folder, which contains snips of 
the elbow curve graphs and scatter plots.
